🌾 Food Product Prediction App
This repository contains a Food Product Prediction App that uses machine learning to predict the type of food product based on various environmental and processing features. The app is built with Streamlit for the front-end and uses a trained machine learning model for predictions.

🚀 Features
User-friendly interface with sliders for input features.
Predicts food products based on provided data.
Displays a feature importance analysis to explain model decisions.
Fully interactive and easy to deploy.

🛠️ Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher.
Install the required Python libraries:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/food-product-prediction.git
cd food-product-prediction
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
🖥️ Usage
Running the App
Ensure food_product_model.pkl is in the project directory.
Run the Streamlit app:
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
Open the local server URL (usually http://localhost:8501/) in your browser.
Using the App
Adjust the sliders to provide values for the features.
Click the Predict button to get the predicted food product.
Explore the Feature Importance Analysis section to understand the model's decisions.
📊 Dataset
The app is built using a dataset with the following key features:

Land use change
Animal Feed
Farm
Processing
Transport
Packaging
Retail
Total Emissions
Eutrophying emissions per kilogram
Greenhouse gas emissions per 1000kcal
You can modify or extend the dataset to retrain the model for more specific use cases.

🛠️ Retraining the Model
If you want to retrain the model:

Replace the dataset file (Food_Production.csv) with your updated dataset.
Use the provided Python scripts for data preprocessing and model training:
python
Copy
Edit
python train_model.py
Save the new model as food_product_model.pkl.
🛠️ Dependencies
Streamlit: For building the interactive app.
Scikit-learn: For training and saving the machine learning model.
Pandas: For data preprocessing.
Matplotlib: For visualizing feature importance.
Install dependencies with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install streamlit scikit-learn pandas matplotlib

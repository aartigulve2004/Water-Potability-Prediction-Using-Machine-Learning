# ðŸ’§ Water Quality Prediction App

This is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts water pollution levels based on air quality and PM2.5 metrics. The application uses a trained machine learning model to make predictions and provides users with insights into water pollution levels.

## Features

- **Country Selection**: Users can select a country from a list of available countries.
- **Air Quality and PM2.5 Input**: Users can input the air quality index and average PM2.5 level.
- **Prediction**: The model predicts the water pollution level based on the inputs.
- **Cities List**: Displays a list of countries (cities) to choose from for prediction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (for the machine learning model)
- Pickle (for model loading)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/water-quality-prediction-app.git
   cd water-quality-prediction-app
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Place your trained model file (water_quality_model.pkl) and the cities dataset (Cities1.csv) in the project directory.

Usage
To run the application locally:

Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd water-quality-prediction-app
Start the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
The app will open in your default web browser.

How It Works
User Inputs: Users select a country and input the air quality index (AQI) and average PM2.5 level.
Prediction: After clicking the "Predict" button, the model predicts the water pollution level.
Cities List: The app displays a list of available countries from which the user can select for predictions.
